As I make my way to the <a title="Ignite Conference" href="http://ignite.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">MSIgnite Conference</a>, I can&#8217;t help but think back at the many wonderful experiences I&#8217;ve had, the people I&#8217;ve met and remained friends with&#8230;
  
This year however, feels different to me.  First, unlike many people attending who are being sponsored by their employers, I&#8217;ve invested in this event and paid for it all out of pocket (lord knows it is expensive).  Perhaps, this brings a different level of appreciation?  Possibly, but  that aside things still feel different for me.

And although the various parties are a nice part of every conference I&#8217;ve attended (we all have stories right?, we should share these over drinks),  that isn&#8217;t what I feel makes it different.   Here are some reasons I feel make this conference different for me and why I look forward to attending.

&nbsp;

<ol type="1">
  <li value="1">
    Meeting George Khalil  (<a title="@SharePointGeorge" href="http://sharepointgeorge.com/" target="_blank">@SharePointGeorge</a>) who resides in Australia.  George specifically planned to attend when he learned that I solidified my plans as well.  I&#8217;ve known George for over 6 years and I certainly consider him a close friend.  But you know what?  We&#8217;ve never met in person, that&#8217;s right.  We&#8217;ve taken on some projects together, shared personal stories, joys and moments of despair throughout the years.  But it is this week that we finally meet in person and I am so stoked about this, I know he is as well.
  </li>

    As an independent consultant in the community, I&#8217;ve contributed in many ways, via forums or events as well as a couple of books.  About a couple of months ago, I reached out to my publisher <a title="Apress" href="http://apress.com/" target="_blank">Apress</a> and expressed to them the desire to work together on another project.  It is at this conference that we get to sit down and discuss our project a bit.  And of course, I meet them in person vs. Skype or email communication.  Call me old-school or traditional, but I prefer in-person conversations.
  </li>
  <li>
    This year, I didn&#8217;t rent a hotel (I personally don&#8217;t like hotels, they feel very sterile to me).  Instead I rented a loft and shared it with a friend.  This just enriches the experience throughout the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lastly, I have procured a few copies of my book <a title="Pro SharePoint 2013 Branding and Responsive Web Development " href="http://www.amazon.com/SharePoint-Branding-Responsive-Development-Experts/dp/1430250283" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pro Responsive Web Development on SharePoint 2013</span> </a>and happily will be giving away free copies during the week.  Look for my tweets <a title="@SharePointOscar" href="http://twitter.com/SharePointOscar" target="_blank">@SharePointOscar </a>
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

I hope you get the most out of the conference, and I hope we get an opportunity to meet, seriously please don&#8217;t be shy, I&#8217;ll be roaming around&#8230;

Cheers,
  
Oscar
