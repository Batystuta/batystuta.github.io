## My daughter's last race for the season

Someone once said, all good things end.  And ski season is fairly close to ending (or not?).  My daugher had her last race last weekend and podiumed again.  I'm a very proud dad, as you probably can tell ;)

### Published an Atom Theme - Working on a VS Code one...
Somehow I managed to publish an Atom theme, great learning experience by the way.  But I was driven to just give back to the community, so I came up with a theme.  The them is called Franken Berry - you know the cereal that we no longer can enjoy?  I loved that cereal when I was a kid, so thought yeah, let's do it!

You can install the theme via Atom or using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
	apm install franken-berry-syntax
{% endhighlight%}
