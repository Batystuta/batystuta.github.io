While working on SharePoint 2010, I thought it would be interesting to view some of the pages via my iPhone.  Not all pages have a mobile view, but one can also use the query string “**?mobile=1**”.  Also, I believe there is a server-side function that may allow developers to render a page in mobile view!

I am using NTLM authentication on this sample site _(the infamous fictitious Contoso, hey at least is not Fabrikam!)_.

The following screenshots show you the a partial experience.  I purposefully made this post short and sweet so I am not covering every detail…

Calendar List Views on the iPhone look decent, you can filter on most Lists as well!

This post is short and sweet, but thought I’d share this!
