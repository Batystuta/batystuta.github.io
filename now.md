## Last Minute Decision - Going to DockerCon 2017
I've been pondering on this for a while, and finally decided to just go.  As an independent consultant is not always easy to have budget for these things but I believe is well worth the expense.

I am excited to attend and meet various folks I've interacted with via various channels.



## Oh Hey! I published an Atom Theme - Working on a VS Code one...
Somehow I managed to publish an Atom theme, great learning experience by the way.  But I was driven to just give back to the community, so I came up with a theme.  The them is called Franken Berry - you know the cereal that we no longer can enjoy?  I loved that cereal when I was a kid, so thought yeah, let's do it!

You can install the theme via Atom or using the following command

{% highlight bash %}
	apm install franken-berry-syntax
{% endhighlight%}

This is what it looks like

## My daughter's last race for the season

Someone once said, all good things must come to an end.  And ski season is fairly close to ending (or not?).  My daugher had her last race last weekend and podiumed again.  I'm a very proud dad, as you probably can tell ;)

Hope you had a great week,
