"What would you say ya do here?" -Bob Slydell (Office Space)


## Lots of skiing

This season has been historical and I fully intend to enjoy it until the last minute, it looks like that would be July?

## Projects and more learning!
I've been very busy helping a pharmaceutical client migrate from one Office 365 Tenant to another.  This involves careful planning, as some content will actually not go into SPO or other O356 workloads but non-Microsoft CMS systems.

Just got my new Macbook Pro 2016, and did a nice clean setup of all my frameworks and apps using a single Brewfile.  If all shit goes downhill, I can just get the Brewfile from my git repo and execute it, boom!

Most recently I've setup Jenkins CI for some NodeJS apps and my Pipeline actually builds Docker containers, man I love that whale!
