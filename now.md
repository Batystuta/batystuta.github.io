## Lots of skiing

This season has been historic and I fully intend to enjoy it until the last minute, it looks like that would be July?

## Projects and more learning!
I've been very busy helping a pharmaceutical client migrate from one Office 365 Tenant to another.  This involves careful planning, as some content will actually not go into SPO or other O356 workloads, but rather non-Microsoft CMS systems.

### New Toy
Just got my new Macbook Pro 2016, and did a nice clean setup of all my frameworks and apps using a single Brewfile.  If all shit goes downhill, I can just get the Brewfile from my git repo and execute it, boom!

### My Journey in CI/CD with Jenkins and Chef Continues
Most recently I've setup Jenkins CI for some NodeJS apps and my Pipeline actually builds Docker containers, man I love that whale!

This week I also joined the Learm [@Chef](https://twitter.com/chef) session, and was delighted to chat with [@momo_ops](https://twitter.com/momo_ops) about best practices and typical workflows amongst other things.  She's awesome!
